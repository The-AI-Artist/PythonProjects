# Band Name Generator

## Project Overview
This is **Project 1** of the **100 Days of Python Projects** series. The **Band Name Generator** is a fun and interactive Python program designed to create unique band names based on user inputs. This project is a beginner-friendly exercise that focuses on basic Python concepts.

## How It Works
1. The program starts with a welcome message for the user.
2. It prompts the user to enter the name of the city they grew up in.
3. Next, it asks for the name of their pet.
4. Using the two inputs, it combines them to generate a creative and personalized band name.
5. The generated band name is then displayed to the user.

## Features
- Interactive input prompts for a personalized experience.
- Simple string concatenation to combine user inputs.
- Provides a fun and engaging way to practice Python basics.

## Example Output
Welcome to Band Name Generator 
What is the name of the city you grew up in? New York 
What's your pet's name? Buddy 
Your Band name could be New York Buddy


## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `input()` function to collect user input.
- Learn string concatenation for combining text elements.
- Write a structured Python script with a clear logical flow.

## About the Series
