# Band Name Generator

## Project Overview
This is **Project 1** of the **100 Python Projects** series. The **Band Name Generator** is a simple and interactive Python program that generates creative band names based on user input. This beginner-level project introduces foundational Python concepts in a fun and engaging way.

## How It Works
1. The program greets the user with a welcome message.
2. It asks for the name of the city the user grew up in.
3. It then requests the name of the userâ€™s pet.
4. The program combines both inputs to generate a unique and personalized band name.
5. The final band name is displayed to the user.

## Features
- Interactive prompts for personalized input.
- Simple string manipulation using concatenation.
- Beginner-friendly logic flow to reinforce programming basics.

## Example Output
Welcome to Band Name Generator
What is the name of the city you grew up in? New York
What's your pet's name? Buddy
Your Band name could be New York Buddy

## Learning Objectives
- Use the `input()` function to capture user input from the console.
- Apply string concatenation to create custom text output.
- Develop structured Python code with a logical sequence.

## About the Series
This project is part of a larger **100 Python Projects** journey, where I aim to build and showcase diverse projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The goal of this series is to solidify my understanding of Python through hands-on application while sharing my progress and insights along the way.
