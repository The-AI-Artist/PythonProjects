# Treasure Island  

## Project Overview  
This is Project 3 of the **100 Days of Python Projects** series. *Treasure Island* is an interactive text-based adventure game built in Python. The player embarks on a journey to find hidden treasure by making a series of choices, each of which determines the outcome of the game. This project demonstrates how to use conditional statements and user input to create an engaging and fun experience.  

## How It Works  
1. The program begins with a welcome message and a visual map to set the theme.  
2. Players are presented with choices at various points in the game.  
3. Each choice leads to a different outcome, including winning the treasure or encountering game-ending scenarios.  
4. The game uses a nested structure of conditionals to handle the different paths and outcomes.  

## Features  
- Interactive gameplay with multiple choice-based decisions.  
- Engaging narrative with themed ASCII art to enhance the experience.  
- Multiple endings depending on the choices made by the player.  
- Beginner-friendly implementation focusing on conditional logic and user input handling.  

## Example Gameplay  
Welcome to Treasure Island.  
Your mission is to find the treasure.  

*You're at a crossroad, where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right".*  
- If you choose "left", you continue your journey.  
- If you choose "right", you fall into a hole. **Game Over.**  

*You arrive at a lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat or "swim" to swim across.*  
- If you wait, you reach the island safely.  
- If you swim, you are attacked by a trout. **Game Over.**  

*At the island, you face three doors: red, yellow, and blue.*  
- Choosing the yellow door leads to the treasure. **You Win!**  
- The other doors result in fire or beasts. **Game Over.**  

## Learning Objectives  
- Understand how to use nested `if`-`else` statements to manage complex decision trees.  
- Learn to take and process user input effectively with the `input()` function.  
- Practice creating text-based games with interactive storytelling.  
- Develop problem-solving skills by designing an engaging user experience.  

## About the Series  
This project is part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** series, where I build Python projects to enhance my skills and share my journey. Each project ranges from beginner to advanced levels, focusing on real-world applications and fun challenges.
