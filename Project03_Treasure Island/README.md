# Treasure Island

## Project Overview

This is **Project 3** of the **100 Python Projects** series. **Treasure Island** is an interactive text-based adventure game built in Python. The player embarks on a quest to find hidden treasure by making a series of choices, each leading to different outcomes. This project introduces the use of conditional statements and user input to create an engaging, choice-driven experience.

## How It Works

1. The program starts with a welcome message and a themed introduction.
2. Players are guided through a series of scenarios, each requiring a decision.
3. Each choice determines whether the player progresses, wins, or ends the game.
4. The story is built using nested conditional statements to handle multiple paths and outcomes.

## Features

* Interactive decision-based gameplay.
* Themed narrative with simple ASCII art to enhance immersion.
* Multiple endings based on user choices.
* Beginner-friendly implementation focusing on conditional logic and input handling.

## Example Output

Welcome to Treasure Island.
Your mission is to find the treasure.

You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right".
→ If you type `left`, you continue your journey.
→ If you type `right`, you fall into a hole. **Game Over.**

You arrive at a lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat or "swim" to swim across.
→ If you type `wait`, you reach the island safely.
→ If you type `swim`, you are attacked by a trout. **Game Over.**

At the island, you see three doors: red, yellow, and blue. Which one do you choose?
→ `Yellow` leads to the treasure. **You Win!**
→ `Red` or `Blue` result in fire or beasts. **Game Over.**

## Learning Objectives

* Use nested `if`-`else` statements to create branching storylines.
* Capture and process user input using the `input()` function.
* Design interactive, text-based games using conditional logic.
* Build storytelling and logic flow for game-based applications.

## About the Series

This project is part of a larger **100 Python Projects** journey, where I aim to build and showcase diverse projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The goal of this series is to solidify my understanding of Python through hands-on application while sharing my progress and insights along the way.

Stay tuned for more projects coming soon!
