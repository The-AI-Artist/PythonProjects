# Tip Calculator

## Project Overview

This is **Project 2** of the **100 Python Projects** series. The **Tip Calculator** is a simple and interactive Python program designed to help users calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a customizable tip percentage. This beginner-level project reinforces essential Python concepts such as user input, arithmetic operations, and output formatting.

## How It Works

1. The program starts with a welcome message.
2. It prompts the user to enter the total bill amount.
3. It then asks what tip percentage the user would like to give.
4. The user is asked how many people will split the bill.
5. The program calculates the total tip amount, adds it to the bill, and divides the total by the number of people.
6. The final amount each person should pay is displayed, rounded to two decimal places.

## Features

* Interactive prompts for user-friendly input.
* Customizable tip percentages (e.g., 10%, 12%, 15%).
* Automatically splits the total bill including tip among the given number of people.
* Rounded output for precise payment amounts.

## Example Output

Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? \$100
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10
How many people to split the bill? 4
Each person should pay: \$27.50

## Learning Objectives

* Use the `input()` function to capture user input from the console.
* Perform arithmetic operations based on user-provided values.
* Format output using string interpolation and rounding techniques.
* Build practical problem-solving skills with real-world use cases.

## About the Series

This project is part of a larger **100 Python Projects** journey, where I aim to build and showcase diverse projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The goal of this series is to solidify my understanding of Python through hands-on application while sharing my progress and insights along the way.

Stay tuned for more projects coming soon!
