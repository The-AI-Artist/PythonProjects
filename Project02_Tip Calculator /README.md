# Tip Calculator

## Project Overview
This is **Project 2** of the **100 Days of Python Projects** series. The **Tip Calculator** is a simple and interactive Python program designed to help users calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a customizable tip percentage. This project is a beginner-friendly exercise that focuses on basic Python concepts, such as taking user input, performing calculations, and formatting output.

## How It Works
1. The program starts with a welcome message for the user.
2. It prompts the user to input the **total bill amount**.
3. Next, the user is asked to specify the **tip percentage** they want to give.
4. Then, the program asks for the number of **people** splitting the bill.
5. Using the inputs, the program calculates the total tip, adds it to the bill, and divides the total by the number of people to determine how much each person should pay.
6. Finally, the program displays the amount each person should pay, rounded to two decimal places.

## Features
- Simple and user-friendly input prompts.
- Calculates the total tip and splits the bill among a specified number of people.
- Allows for customizable tip percentages (e.g., 10%, 12%, 15%).
- Rounds the final amount each person should pay to two decimal places for precision.

## Example Output
Welcome to the tip calculator! 
What was the total bill? $100 
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 
How many people to split the bill? 4 
Each person should pay: $28.75

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use the `input()` function to collect user input.
- Learn how to perform arithmetic calculations with user-provided values.
- Practice formatting and rounding output in Python.
- Improve problem-solving skills by designing a real-world application.

## About the Series
This project is part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** series, where I create and publish a variety of Python projects, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each project is designed to improve my Python skills and share my learning journey.
