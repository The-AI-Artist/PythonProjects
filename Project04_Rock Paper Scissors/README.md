# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Overview  
This is Project 4 of the **100 Days of Python Projects** series. *Rock Paper Scissors* is a text-based game built in Python where players compete against the computer in the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This project showcases the use of conditional statements, random number generation, and user input handling to create an engaging and fun experience.

## How It Works  
1. The program begins by displaying ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors to enhance the visual appeal.  
2. Players are prompted to choose Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).  
3. The computer makes a random choice from the same options.  
4. The game compares the choices and determines the outcome (win, lose, or draw) based on standard game rules:  
   - Rock beats Scissors.  
   - Scissors beats Paper.  
   - Paper beats Rock.  
   - Identical choices result in a draw.  
5. The result is displayed to the player, along with the corresponding ASCII art for both choices.

## Features  
- Interactive gameplay that pits the player against the computer.  
- ASCII art to visually represent the choices and enhance engagement.  
- Simple and intuitive user input system.  
- Randomized computer choices for unpredictable outcomes.  
- Error handling for invalid inputs to ensure a smooth gaming experience.  

## Example Gameplay  
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors.  
*You choose Rock (0).*  

    _______
---'   ____)
      (_____)
      (_____)
      (____)
---.__(___)

*Computer chooses Scissors (2).*  

    _______
---'   ____)____
          ______)
       __________)
      (____)
---.__(___)

*Result:*  
You win!

## Learning Objectives  
- Understand how to use conditional statements to evaluate multiple scenarios.  
- Learn how to handle user input and validate it effectively.  
- Use the `random` module to introduce unpredictability into programs.  
- Practice using lists to store and access related data.  
- Gain familiarity with text-based game development.
