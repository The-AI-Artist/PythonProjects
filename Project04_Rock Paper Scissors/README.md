# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Overview

This is **Project 4** of the **100 Python Projects** series. **Rock Paper Scissors** is a classic text-based game where players compete against the computer by choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. This beginner-friendly project introduces the use of conditional statements, random number generation, and user input handling in a fun and interactive way.

## How It Works

1. The program displays ASCII art representations of Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
2. The player is prompted to choose Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
3. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
4. The game compares the player’s choice with the computer’s and determines the result:

   * Rock beats Scissors
   * Scissors beats Paper
   * Paper beats Rock
   * Same choices result in a draw
5. The outcome is displayed, along with the ASCII art for both the player’s and computer’s choices.

## Features

* Interactive game that lets you play against the computer.
* ASCII art visuals for each option to enhance the experience.
* Random computer choices using Python’s `random` module.
* Simple and intuitive input system.
* Error handling for invalid inputs.

## Example Output

What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors.
You chose Rock:

```
    _______
---'   ____)
      (_____)
      (_____)
      (____)
---.__(___)
```

Computer chose Scissors:

```
    _______
---'   ____)____
          ______)
       __________)
      (____)
---.__(___)
```

You win!

## Learning Objectives

* Use conditional logic to evaluate multiple outcomes.
* Implement user input validation for a better user experience.
* Apply the `random` module to simulate unpredictable behavior.
* Work with lists to store and access ASCII art representations.
* Build simple text-based games using core Python concepts.

## About the Series

This project is part of a larger **100 Python Projects** journey, where I aim to build and showcase diverse projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The goal of this series is to solidify my understanding of Python through hands-on application while sharing my progress and insights along the way.

Stay tuned for more projects coming soon!
